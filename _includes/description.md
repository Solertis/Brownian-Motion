An interactive physics simulation of Brownian Motion!
Brownian Motion is the random motion of particles that are suspended in
a gas or a liquid. Drag the first slider to see what's going on behind
the scenes and play around with the physical parameters. You can also
download a snapshot if your particles draw you something inspiring.

Watch the introductory video: [Brownian Motion Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDfQqbWTP58).

Watch the MinutePhysics on Brownian Motion: [Albert Einstein: The Size and Existence of Atoms](http://youtu.be/nrUBPO6zZ40).
